/**
 * It represents a model railways rolling stock manufacturer.
 *
 * <p>Two distinct family of manufacturer exists:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code industrial}: these manufactures produce models using the die casting method;
 *   <li>{@code brass models}: these manufacturers produce models which are made of brass or similar
 *       alloys. They are usually more expensive than the industrial series due to the limited
 *       production quantities and the {@code "hand made"} nature of the production.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class allows one company to have local branches for a given country, either a local
 * office or a distribution company.
